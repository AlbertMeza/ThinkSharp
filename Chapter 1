Exercise 1.1:

1.
Statement: A part of a program that specifies a computation from the ones below. Anything that effects how the program runs. 
    input: Get data from the keyboard, or a file, or some other device.
    output: Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.
    math: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.
    testing: Check for certain conditions and run the appropriate sequence of statements.
    repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.
  
Comment: A part of a program that contains information about the program, but that
has no effect when the program runs. Initiated by "//" or /*"

2. 
portable means that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. This is because of the nature of high-level language 

3. 
Executable: Another name for object code that is ready to run. 
It is ready to run because it's been translated from the source code of a high level language to a low level language that a computer can read and execute. 


Exercise 1.2:
As we continue, I will explain the point of every word within this program.
===========================================================================
using System;

namespace ThinkSharpChapter1Exercise1_2
{
    internal class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");

            Console.WriteLine("Try typing 'cw' -> tab tab for your next statement!");

            //The cw tab tab is meant for a keyboard shortcut to write 'Console.WriteLine()' quicker
        }
    }
}

Exercise 1.3

1. Every squiggly braces should have a matching opening and closing equivalent, the location of them will gradually become apparent

2. Every squiggly braces should have a matching opening and closing equivalent, the location of them will gradually become apparent

3. Main must be written correctly for it to compile, C# is case and spelling sensitive. Main doesn't equal Mian or main 
(Main != mian or Main != main, != is the C# way to demonstrate "not equal"

4. For now always include static in -> public static void Main(String[] args)

5. For now always include public in -> public static void Main(String[] args)
   This will compile without public but it's good to build the habit now.
   
6. Console is a Class located within the System library and needs to be included for now to use WriteLine, this will become second nature
   Using.System = a library, a collection of classes
   Console = a class, an object with properties and methods
   WriteLine = a method, a function to make tasks easier

7. C# continues to be case sensitive, WriteLine != Writeline

8. Console.Write and Console.WriteLine are different methods within the Console Object
   Console.Write will continue to write or display within the same line
   Console.WriteLine will create a new line prior to displaying the input 

9. Every parentheses should have a matching opening and closing equivalent

10. Semi-colon's are the equivalent of a period in the english language. You need one to end a statement within C#.
