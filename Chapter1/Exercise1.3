Exercise 1.3

1. Every squiggly braces should have a matching opening and closing equivalent, the location of them will gradually become apparent

2. Every squiggly braces should have a matching opening and closing equivalent, the location of them will gradually become apparent

3. Main must be written correctly for it to compile, C# is case and spelling sensitive. Main doesn't equal Mian or main 
(Main != mian or Main != main, != is the C# way to demonstrate "not equal"

4. For now always include static in -> public static void Main(String[] args)

5. For now always include public in -> public static void Main(String[] args)
   This will compile without public but it's good to build the habit now.
   
6. Console is a Class located within the System library and needs to be included for now to use WriteLine, this will become second nature
   Using.System = a library, a collection of classes
   Console = a class, an object with properties and methods
   WriteLine = a method, a function to make tasks easier

7. C# continues to be case sensitive, WriteLine != Writeline

8. Console.Write and Console.WriteLine are different methods within the Console Object
   Console.Write will continue to write or display within the same line
   Console.WriteLine will create a new line prior to displaying the input 

9. Every parentheses should have a matching opening and closing equivalent

10. Semi-colon's are the equivalent of a period in the english language. You need one to end a statement within C#.
